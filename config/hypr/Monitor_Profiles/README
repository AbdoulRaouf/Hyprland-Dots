# Create a Monitor profile you want to on this directory

# Create a unique file name i.e. Mirror, or Office, Scale, etc etc

# tip: You can easily create a profile using nwg-displays
# after creating a profile using nwg-displays, you can copy the ~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf file to this directory


# Note, after selecting Profiles wanted via Rofi (SUPER SHIFT E), previous content of ~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf will be backed up as previous
