* All main themes or configs are located in ~/.local/share/rofi/themes 
* If you want to edit the config, that is where you should edit NOT here 

* To load a new theme, manually edit the file path below or choose desired theme via rofi theme selector 

* Alternative way to Load (preferred) own cooked by Ja 
* SUPER CTRL R - Choose style

* If you have edited a config, rename it with a unique name. During update, the contents of
